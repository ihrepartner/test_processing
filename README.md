# Short example on how to work with the processing.org

This short example just demonstrates ho processing.org and html-files
are working together.

- you need processing installed
- you need a local webserver

## 1. Install Processing.org
From [processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download/)
download processing for your operation system

## 2. Employ this repo
- download and unzip it
- start a **local webserver** (MAMP or Webstorm)
- open `sketch.html` in Chrome Webbrowser
- sketch.pde should sent a white ball through a blue
canvas from left to right
- if you see this, you know everything is working correctly
